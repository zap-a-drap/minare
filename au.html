         MINARE is the annual geo-mining fest of the department of mining engineering. MINARE 2020 is the 5th edition of this extravagant conclave. MINARE is organised with the objective of providing the society of mining engineers in the making a deeper insight into their subject and its impact on the induﬆry, India being a major reservoir of natural resources like coal and petroleum. Various technical events, workshops, gueﬆ lectures and fun events are organized during the course of this mega event. The events are ﬁlled with numerous intriguing guest lectures, workshops, case study presentation solutions and paper presentation.  The mining extravaganza not only has a series of competent exhibition of experience and knowledge but also has a pinch of cultural fervor to welcome ﬆudents from across the length and breadth of the country.
 The fest is organized by the Mining Engineering Society with attendees from various institutes of national and state importance like IIT KGP, ISM Dhanbad, IIT BHU, NIT Raipur ,IIEST Shibpur, Adarsh College of Engineering (ACE) Angul, GCE Keonjhar, VNS Bhopal who eager to deepen their knowledge on cutting edge technologies. We are keen at both surfacing professionals together for both education and networking. Like the phoenix, we rise from the ashes, we are planning to take our previous version which witnessed a participation of 200+ students to greater heights. This hugely anticipated edition is set to target 300+ students among the elite institutions of India- IITs, NITs, GETs and other state engineering colleges of Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. This fest is limited to students only, no industry/company can participate in any technical events.
